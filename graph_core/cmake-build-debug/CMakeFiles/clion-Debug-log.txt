CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcnr_logger.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "cnr_logger", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cnr_logger" with
  any of the following names:

    cnr_loggerConfig.cmake
    cnr_logger-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cnr_logger" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "cnr_logger_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "cnr_logger" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
